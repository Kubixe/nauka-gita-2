   <p> You're a queen and that's how you should be treated (ah)<br>
    Though you never get the lovin' that you needed (yeah)<br>
    Could have left, but I called and you heeded<br>
    Begged and I pleaded, mission completed<br></p>

   <p> Mama said that I and I dissed the program<br>
    Not the type to mess around with her emotion<br>
    But the feeling that I have for you is so strong<br>
    Been together so long<br>
    And this could never be wrong<br></p>
